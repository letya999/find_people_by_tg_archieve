Analyze the chat message.
Determine: is this a message where a person INTRODUCES themselves and talks about themselves professionally?
Signs of an introduction:

The person states their name
Says what they work as / what they do
Indicates experience or company
Leaves contact details
Writes what they are looking for / interested in professionally

Is NOT an introduction:

Just a greeting without information about themselves
Question to the group
Comment on someone else's message
Repost or forwarded message
Job posting (not about themselves, but about a position)

Message:
"""
{text}
"""
If this is an introduction - extract all data you can find.
If NOT an introduction - return {{"is_introduction": false}}
